# Project Conventions

## Data Shape Convention

Datasets deliver samples in their natural geometric shape (e.g. `[C, H, W]`
for images, `[C, L]` for time series). Any `reshape`, `flatten`, or `view`
operation is the **first layer of the model**, not a preprocessing step in
the dataset. This:

- keeps dataset code independent of downstream model topology
- allows one dataset to feed models with different input ranks
- matches the PyTorch / Keras / elastic-ai.creator IR convention, so a future
  ir2c can compile each shape transform to a corresponding C layer

For flatten-to-2D, use `flattenLayerInit()` from `FlattenApi.h`.
