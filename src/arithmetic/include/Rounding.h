 *
 * The float->int32 cast is data-dependent and is UB on overflow
 * (C17 6.3.1.4, #189). When compiled with -DODT_SEED_GUARD (unit-test/CI
 * builds; off for release/MCU) the cast is guarded: it fails fast when the
 * rescaled value leaves no int32 headroom for one worst-case int16xint16
 * product (32768*32767). NaN-robust via !(x <= T): a 0*inf=NaN from an
 * underflowed accumulator scale is caught, not bypassed. Release builds run
 * the raw cast (UBSan #204 covers occurrences there). */
